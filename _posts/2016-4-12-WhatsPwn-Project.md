excerpt: Linux Tool to extract sensitive data and inject payloads into any Android devices.
---

### DESCRIPTION

This is a linux tool that let you extract sensitive data, inject backdoor payloads and shells into any Android device.

The first version of _WhatsPwn_ contained a lot of bugs that in some system it was just _unrunnable_. That is why I decided to rebuild the tool from scratch.
