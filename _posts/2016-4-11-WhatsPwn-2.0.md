excerpt: Linux Tool to extract sensitive data and inject payloads into any Android devices.
---

There is a new version of the linux tool _WhatsPwn_ which features new payload options like meterpreter injection or the ability to create hidden or visible payloads and inject them into any android device.
It is still in beta stage so there may be some bugs and some features may not work properly but updates are constantly rolling, so expect updates very soon.

You can find the complete changelog [here](https://github.com/jlrodriguezf/WhatsPwn#changelog).

This is  brief tutorial on how to use this tool, which just makes the process of extracting sensitive data like WhatsApp databases and fotos, and injecting backdoor payloads a lot easier.

### INSTALLATION
The first thing you need to do is clone the [repository](https://github.com/jlrodriguezf/WhatsPwn "WhatsPwn Repository")

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlrodriguezf/WhatsPwn.git
```

Once you have done that we can proceed.

### CONFIGURATION
There are two files that you might want to edit first, the _config_ file and the _server_ file.

##### MAIN CONFIGURATION

The __config__ file is where you put all the main variables corresponding to your system.
This is how the file looks like:

```bash
##############################################################################
#                              PAYLOAD OPTIONS                               #
##############################################################################
PAYLOAD=""
PAYLOAD_NAME=""
PAYLOAD_PORT=""
PAYLOAD_IP=""
LEGITIMATE_APK=""
##############################################################################
#                                MAIN OPTIONS                                #
##############################################################################
PATHEXT="~/"
BACKUPZIPNAME="filesystem_linux"
USER="--user 0"
AUTOMODE=1
```
Here is the list of all the configuration variables:

* __PAYLOAD__: It specifies the payload to use. If you already have your own you can put it in here with the full path and ending with _.apk_.
* __PAYLOAD\_NAME__: This is the name of the output payload name **_without_.apk**. When you want to generate multiples payloads you might want to set the default payload name so that the process became more efficient as the program would not ask you for the name every time you want to generate one.
* __PAYLOAD\_PORT__: The port to use for payload reverse connections. You may want to specefiy the default for the same reason as the above.
* __PAYLOAD\_IP__: This is the IP the payload will connect back to. This is your external or internal ip or even your dynamic DNS address.
* __LEGITIMATE\_IP__: This is the path of the legitimate app the programm will inject meterpreter to with full path. This is just for injection.
* __PATHEXT__: This is the the path where all the extracted data is going to be. By _default_ this is the root directory.
* __BACKUPZIPNAME__: This is the name of the _.zip_ file containing all the extracted data. By _default_ this is _filesystem\_linux_.
* __USER__: This is how the payload's service will launch. You don't have to worry about this as this is just for compatibility for some android devices.
* __AUTOMODE__: This boolean tells the program to ask for every variable that is missing in the _FULL ATTACK_ at the beginning so once it has started you don't have to worry about typing names or paths.

##### SERVER CONFIGURATION

If you have set up a server where you want to be all your extracted files you can place your configuration in the _server_ file.
This is how the server file looks like:

```bash
SERV=""
USRSERV=""
OUTPUTDIRSERV="~/extracted/"
```
This is very easy you just need to change the variables to suit your server configuration.

* __SERV__: This is the ip to connect, this can be external or dynamic DNS name.
* __USRSERV__: This is the username of the server, i.e, _root_.
* __OUTPUTDIRSERV__: The path to put the extracted de data.

Just to clarify things, the program will try to connect to `<USRSERV>@<SERV>/<OUTPUTDIRSERV>`.
