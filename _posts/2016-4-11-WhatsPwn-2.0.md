excerpt: Linux Tool to extract sensitive data and inject payloads into any Android devices.
---

There is a new version of the linux tool _WhatsPwn_ which features new payload options like meterpreter injection or the ability to create hidden or visible payloads and inject them into any android device.
It is still in beta stage so there may be some bugs and some features may not work properly but updates are constantly rolling, so expect updates very soon.

This is  brief tutorial on how to use this tool, which just makes the process of extracting sensitive data like WhatsApp databases and fotos, and injecting backdoor payloads a lot easier.

### INSTALLATION
The first thing you need to do is clone the [repository](https://github.com/jlrodriguezf/WhatsPwn "WhatsPwn Repository")

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlrodriguezf/WhatsPwn.git
```

Once you have done that we can proceed.

### CONFIGURATION
There are two files that you might want to edit first, the _config_ file and the _server_ file
